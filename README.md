# DeviceToggle
Turns a device (from Windows Device Manager) on if it's off and vice versa (or restarts it).

## Use
* Download the script by clicking `Code`, then `Download ZIP` and extract it to a folder of your choice;
* Open `DeviceToggle.ps1` with any text editor, read the comments, do what's written and save;
* Double click `DeviceToggle.bat` to start it (you can create a shortcut to the Desktop for this one, but the two originals need to be in the same directory).

N.B.: You may encounter a SmartScreen alert. This happens with every executable that doesn't have enough downloads to be considered reputable by Microsoft. Just click `More info`, then `Run anyway`. It also need administration privileges to disable and enable devices, so you'll get a UAC prompt.
